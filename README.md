# BeepPool-Windows-Miner
A small GUI for entering the required parameters for starting the miner for BeepPool

Initial version of the BeepPool Windows Miner, based on the packages provided by Beep on: https://beeppool.org/downloads.html

This is just a GUI for entering your wallet, set the amount of cores you want to use and give the worker a name, everything else is made by others in the Nimiq-community.

Download .zip, unzip and start BeePool-Windows-Miner.exe. Enter your settings and hit the start mining button and that's it. On restart your settings will be pre-filled.
