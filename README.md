# BeepPool-Miner
A small GUI for entering the required parameters for starting the miner for BeepPool

BeepPool Windows Miner, based on the packages provided by Beep on: https://beeppool.org/downloads.html

This is a GUI for entering your wallet, set the amount of cores you want to use and give the worker a name. The miner can then be viewed and handled inside the GUI. The miner itself is made by others in the Nimiq-community and not by me.
